        <hr class="border-primary">
        <p>
            I come from an arts background academically, studying international relations and history for my bachelors degree. In my bachelors degree I specifically studied
            topics such terrorism, extremism, and the rise of radical ideology throughout history and into the modern day. My final year project focused on the rise of the
            'Alt-right', trying to define them and separate them from other far-right groups in the US and Europe. Previously I have also worked in jobs such as retail, and
            goods inwards assistant for a number of years.

            Although it is quite the jump going from studying arts to software development, I do have some experience in the field of software development. I worked for a
            software company as an intern helping with Quality Assurance which made me learn a lot about the process of developing and deploying software and what skills
            are needed to work in that field. Now I am studying software development and hope to get a job in that field after graduating next year.

        <h3 class="text-primary">My Favourite Projects</h3>
        <hr class="border-primary">
        <p>
            My two favourite projects up to this point were both in my final year of my bachelors degree. Firstly, my project on the rise of fascism in Japan, the hijacking of religious and traditional
            values by the Imperial Japanese state to promote a war hungry ideology. My other favourite project was my final year project on the Alt-right, looking at the characteristics of the movement
            and contrasting it to other white supremacist movements.

        <p>
            <strong>How do you think this page represents you now?</strong><br>
            This page is a good marker to see what I have accomplished up to this point academically and how certain skills can be translated to my current master's degree. It is also a good way to track
            what skills I have learned relevant to my current field of study and what I need to do to accomplish my near and future goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If you could expand the site, what sections would you add?</strong><br>
            I would add sections for detailed project portfolios. This could act as a way to demonstrate skills and technical expertise. An area or tab for a cv which employers could look at, and perhaps some
            links to Indeed or LinkedIn in which I could be contacted. A blog section could be a good addition to track my progress academically every week/month, keeping track of weaknesses and strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What features would you like to implement if you gained more web development skills?</strong><br>
            I would like to implement interactive elements like animations, a dynamic project gallery, and integration with APIs for real-time data display. Additionally, I would enhance the site's responsiveness and accessibility.
